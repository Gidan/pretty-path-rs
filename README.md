# pretty-path-rs
Small utility to print all the paths listed in the PATH variable in a more readable way.

This is a small exercise that I do to explore a language I am learning. It could be a handy command, but It is not meant to solve any specific problem or to be used in a day to day routine.
If you find it useful, feel free to clone/fork.
